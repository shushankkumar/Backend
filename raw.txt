dynamic routes - many times u see routes and only one part will be changed.
like - /author/shushank
       /author/golu
       /author/goldy ... there comes dynamic routing that don't create many times.

     -----------------  
first goes the browser
write url as per your choice
and create your url route
send res anything
and make dynamic of this url, think of that which part is dynamic and marl :(colon) of that part before route.
--------
app.get("/profile/:username", function(req,res){
    req.params.username
    res.render("working"); 
});

app.get("/profile/:username/:age", function(req,res){
    res.send(`Welcome, ${req.params.username} of age ${req.params.age}`);
});

req.params -  anything before colon says its dynamic
